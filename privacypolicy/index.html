          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <br><p>Subsurface Studios offers the game Compensation VR, a free online video game made for Virtual Reality headsets, which includes its own website. (https://compensationvr.tk/) This policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and store your personal information.</p>
          <br><h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
          <br><p>Subsurface Studios generally collect very little information, compared to other VR games. Personal information is a type of information that is related to an identifiable human being.
          <ul>
               <li>We collect age, as you have to be 13 or older to play our game.</li>
               <li>We receive audio data for our voice chat features. We also may collect audio data, as it's easier for moderation. We never give out information to third parties unless required by law, and we never store any audio if you are alone.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <br><h2>Where are the sources of information?</h2>
          <br><p>We collect information directly from you, for example:
               <ul>
                    <li>From the login screen where you create an account.</li>
                    <li>From online rooms you speak within.</li>
               </ul>
          </p>
          <br><h2>Children under 13</h2>
          <br><p>Following COPPAâ€™s laws, we cannot store information from children under 13. As we do not want to get into major legal trouble, we have decided to never allow children under 13 onto our platform. Any child abusing this rule will be banned, and their information deleted unless they prove they are 13 or over.</p>
          <br><h2>What purposes do we collect information for?</h2>
          <br><p>
               <ul>
                    <li>To moderate servers, IF needed. We won't collect information if we do not need too, unless someone has a bad case with moderation.</li>
               </ul>
          </p>
          <br><h2>How will we notify users if this changes?</h2>
          <br><p>We will notify our users if the Privacy Policy changes through Discord, <a href="../">our website</a>, or inside our game, if necessary.</p>
