            <p class="left">
                Compensation VR is a VR Social Multiplayer game, developed by Subsurface Studios.<br>
                Our primary intention is to be a fun and engaging experience for all.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="left">
                But you probably already knew that, so let's dive a little deeper.<br>
                <br>
                Compensation VR was started in february 2021 by two teenagers, in the vein of social VR games like Rec Room, VRChat, NeosVR, and more.<br>
                Since it's inception, Compensation has grown to include a small team of developers, designers, and artists.<br>
                Compensation VR has served (and will continue to serve) as a learning experience for all of us developers, as well as a social & creative space for all.<br>
                <br>
                We do our best to enforce a fair and open environment for all to enjoy, by providing ample guidance & a clear Code of Conduct for all users.<br>
                <br>
                With more to come in the future, and even more being developed right this moment, why not give it a shot?
