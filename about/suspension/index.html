            <h1>Room Suspension</h1>
            <p>
                So. Either due to direct moderator intervention, or a series of reports against it, your room has been suspended.
            </p>
            <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
            <p class="left">
                Suspension is a consequence of alleged violations of our Creator Code of Conduct. Access to your room has been removed from all users,
                including yourself, while we investigate the room. We apologize for the need to remove your access, however, if you were to modify the
                room during our investigation, it would cause significant problems for us.
            </p>
            <h3>What can I do?</h3>
            <p class="left">
                For now, wait. We (the Compensation moderation team) will investigate your room, and search for any potential breaches of our CCoC.
                In the meantime, your room will be inaccessable to <b>any</b> users, in case your room does contain content in poor taste.
            </p>
            <h3>Can I appeal?</h3>
            <p class="left">
                No. Room suspension is a temporary state indicating that your room is under investigation, and therefore, is not appealable.
                Once our investigation concludes, your room will either be reinstated as normal, or terminated.
                In the event your room is terminated, you and all users will permanently lose access to the room, and depending on the 
                severity of your violations, your account itself may recieve additional moderation action.
            </p>
            <h3>My room has been terminated!</h3>
            <p class="left">
                If you know with 100% certainty that you did not break the CCoC at all in your room, you may appeal a termination. For more information, 
                please see <a href="../termination">this page</a> on room termination.
