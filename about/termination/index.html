            <h1>Room Termination</h1>
            <p>
                After a review by our moderation team (in the Suspended state) your room has been <b>terminated</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
            <p class="left">
                We found one or more unnacceptable violations of our Creator Code of Conduct (CCoC) in your room, 
                and we were unable to manually remedy them. Therefore, access to your room has been revoked from all
                users of Compensation, including you.
            </p>
            <h3>Can I appeal this decision?</h3>
            <p class="left">
                If you have absolute 100% certainty that your room contained no CCoC violations, or you are willing
                to remedy all of them yourself, we <strong>may</strong> choose to reinstate your room, or investigate
                it a second time.
            </p>
            <h3>How can I appeal?</h3>
            <p class="left">
                Please contact lead UGC developer raven._.dev on our <a href="https://discord.com/w2cgRjWkdb">Discord</a>.

                expect a decision on your appeal within 10 business days.
