        <h1>Terms Of Service</h1>
        <p>
            The Compensation VR Terms Of Service are the legal rules that you agree to upon downloading or playing the game.
            <br>They are as follows:
            <br><h2>1.0 - Usage</h2>
            <br>By downloading Compensation VR (henceforth referred to as Compensation VR, Compensation, the Service, or CVR), you accept that you have read and fully understand these terms and conditions, and accept that any violation of them will result in suspension of your usage of the Service, or in very extreme cases, legal action or litigation against your person.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>You also agree that Compensation VR and its development and moderation team may, at any time, with or without reason, permanently revoke your access and usage of the Service.
            <br><h2>1.1 - Code Of Conduct</h2>
            <br>By using the Service and creating an account in Compensation, you agree to the Code Of Conduct, described both here and in-game. In the event you breach the Code Of Conduct, you understand that your usage of the Service may be suspended either temporarily or permanently, with or without any prior warning, written or otherwise. The Code Of Conduct is listed here.
            <br>- Don't be toxic, like saying slurs, being racist or homophobic or transphobic, or ruining anyone's reputation (outside or inside Compensation VR). Violating this can result in suspension of your account.
            <br>- Stay positive!
            <br>- To create an account, you must be 13 or older. If you are under 13, your account will be deleted.
            <br>- Don't say or do anything NSFW or sexual, except when all parties in the lobby are confirmed to be fine with it.
            <br>- Don't modify the game without direct permission from the developers.
            <br>- Usage of exploits and hacks, or the possibility to use exploits and hacks must be reported at once.
            <br>- Pulling game files is permitted, but only for non-commercial and entirely non- malicious purposes.
            <br>
            <br>Violation of the above Code Of Conduct will result in suspension, temporary or permanent, of your rights to use the Service.
            <br>
            <br><h2>1.2 - Concent Creation</h2>
            <br>Compensation VR contains multiple features that cater to creative users, allowing them to create virtual worlds for other users to view and experience. Abuse of these features, as specified here or otherwise, will result in suspension of your usage of the Service.
            <br>Compensation VR Creator Code Of Conduct
            <br>
            <br>-NO SEXUAL CONTENT WHATSOEVER.
            <br>-Do not create experiences or objects intended to damage another user's hardware or software in any way.
            <br>-Do not intentionally create experiences that can trigger epilepsy, or motion sickness even with the built in safety for motion sickness, or with the ability to trigger any adverse mental or physical effect in users.
            <br>-Do not create experiences designed to damage another user's reputation (in-game or in real life).
            <br><h2>1.3 - Broadcasting</h2>
            <br>
            <br>Compensation VR allows all users to broadcast any VXOâ€™s or any community game while still following the Code Of Conduct, and the broadcasting rules.
            <br>
            <br><h2>Broadcasting Rules</h2>
            <br>
            <br>- Any video uploaded must be on any website that isnt NSFW.
            <br>
            <br>- Anything on video or livestream that breaks our Code Of Conduct, or Terms Of Service will be used to get your account either suspended or banned.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br><h2>1.4 - Beta</h2>
            <br>Compensation VR is like any other game, with development process, and ups and downs. We, as a team, want all of you to try our game. But, as we are early in development, we can trust only a select few that want to try out our game, to help playtest, find bugs, and find empty spots we can patch up with your suggestions. As a beta tester, you must not give out files to other non beta testers. If this happens, your beta tester status will be revoked, and your account will be banned. If the files you gave out, the beta testing may be ended, and any accounts involved will be deleted too. To become a beta tester, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/KxF94b7aKQ" target="_blank">discord server</a>.
            <br>This section may be replaced or deleted after some time.
            <br>
            <br><h2>1.4.1 - Platforms (public release, aka 1.0 version/early access, for replacement of the beta section)</h2>
            <br>We have released our game to the public, to enjoy. To play on PCVR, you may download it using the Official Launcher. If you use Oculus Quest 1 or Oculus Quest 2, it is available on the Oculus Quest Store, in the App Lab section, or through the official launcher. Sending game files to others without the express permission of the development team may result in suspension of your account.
            <br>
            <br><h2>1.5 - Currency</h2>
            <br>Compensation VR has in-game 'items' that can be purchased, but not with Real Life currency. To hold realism, Compensation VR has its own currency. The currency is called Pineapple Slices. This currency cannot be bought with real world money, and will never have the option for now. If you have questions you may contact the developers through the Compensation VR Discord Server, or in-game.
