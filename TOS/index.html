            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>
                The Vigor XR Terms Of Service are the legal rules that you agree to upon downloading or playing the game.
                <br>They are as follows:
            </p>

            <h2>1.0 - Usage</h2>
            <p>
                By downloading Vigor XR (henceforth referred to as Vigor XR, Vigor, the Service, or VXR), you accept that you have read and fully understand these terms and conditions, and accept that any violation of them will result in suspension of your usage of the Service, or in very extreme cases, legal action or litigation against your person.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>You also agree that Vigor XR and its development and moderation team may, at any time, with or without reason, permanently revoke your access and usage of the Service.
            </p>

            <h2>1.1 - Code Of Conduct</h2>
            <p>
                By using the Service and creating an account in Vigor, you agree to the Code Of Conduct, described both here and in-game. In the event you breach the Code Of Conduct, you understand that your usage of the Service may be suspended either temporarily or permanently, with or without any prior warning, written or otherwise.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Violation of the above Code Of Conduct will result in suspension, temporary or permanent, of your rights to use the Service.
            </p>

            <h2>1.2 - Concent Creation</h2>
            <p>
                Vigor XR contains multiple features that cater to creative users, allowing them to create virtual worlds for other users to view and experience. Abuse of these features, as specified here or otherwise, will result in suspension of your usage of the Service.
                <br>Vigor XR Creator Code Of Conduct
                <br>
                <br>-NO SEXUAL CONTENT WHATSOEVER.
                <br>-Do not create experiences or objects intended to damage another user's hardware or software in any way.
                <br>-Do not intentionally create experiences that trigger motion sickness beyond a reasonable degree. (NOTE: "a reasonable degree" is a vague term and in the end, all moderation decisions are performed at Moderator and Developer discretion. Vigor XR does not and can not guarantee completely consistent moderation across all platforms and users.)
                <br>-Do not create experiences designed to damage another user's reputation (in-game or in real life).
