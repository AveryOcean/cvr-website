            <h2>Major Changes</h2>
            <p class="left">
                Unfortunately, there aren't really many major changes this update. We've mainly been working on backend updates and fixes,
                as you'll see later in these notes. We've also been working on a fairly secret project, which you should see next update.
                While we're excited to show you that, we had to take time away from this update to work on it.
                Apologies!
            </p>

            <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
            <p class="left">
                <li>Fixed an issue where the solid pink T-Shirt was actually just a red-stained white shirt. It's actually pink now, no more tie dye, for now!</li>
                <li>Fixed an issue where the Creation Tool spawn button would still appear even if you couldn't access it. It wouldn't spawn for security reasons, but your game would crash. No more!</li>
            </p>

            <h2>Upcoming - Creation Tools!</h2>
            <p class="left">
                For almost 6 months now, we've been working with a selective group of creators and staff called the Creative Tools Beta Program,
                which gives them exclusive access to the CVR creation tools early.
                Well, one month from the release of this update, (New Years 2023, January 1st) we're releasing our full creation tools suite to the
                general public! We're extremely excited to see what you will do with this when the time comes.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="left">
                Coming into the new year, we're extremely excited for our 1 year release anniversary. It's insane to think that it's been almost a year, and see how far we've come.
                We've got huge things planned for the new year, so stay tuned! Until then, happy holidays, and have
