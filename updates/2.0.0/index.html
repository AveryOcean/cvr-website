            <p class="left">
                It's finally here. <br>
                After nearly two whole years of blood, sweat, and tears, we've finally released our cornerstone update. <br>
                Being the original reason behind Compensation, creation tools have always held a special place in our heart.
                For that reason, we've been working extremely hard non-stop on this update this whole month. <br>
                Technically, this update started way back in the 2021.X.X versions, where you could spawn pizza props with the 3D printer. <br>
                Now, it's developed into a fully featured creation system, complete with mesh editing, booleans, OBJ imports, and more. <br>
                From the bottom of all our hearts, <b>thank you</b> for staying with us all this time.
            </p>
