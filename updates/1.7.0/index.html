            <h2>Major Updates</h2>
            <h3>Redone Apartment</h3>
            <p class="left">
                We've completely redone <codeblock>CVR/<highlight>Apartment</highlight></codeblock> to be more performant, better looking, and generally a better experience.
                It's nearing 1 THOUSAND visits, so we figured it was time to spruce things up a bit! If you have suggestions for furniture or other additions to the Apartment, please
                let us know on <a href="https://cvr.canny.io">our canny page</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Automatic Error Reporting</h3>
            <p class="left">
                Automatic Error Reporting (also known as AER internally) is a brand new feature we've added! 
                In short, it's an opt-in system that gives us information about errors your game encounters.
                We hope this will help us fix any issues that you may not report to us, without any intervention required!
                We're going to make a video explaining this system soon, so stay tuned!
            </p>

            <h2>Legal Changes</h2>
            <h3>Privacy Policy Update</h3>
            <p class="left">
                In order to implement AER, we needed to update our privacy policy to allow it. If you haven't already, please make sure to re-read it <a href="../../legal/privacy-policy/">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
            <h3>Website Rewrite</h3>
            <p class="left">
                We know the website currently doesn't look the best, so we're currently working to figure out how we want to make a better one.
                In the meantime, hopefully it doesn't hurt your eyes <i>too</i> much. ;)

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>We're going to be trying to put out more content on our YouTube channel here soon, and we have some <strong>big</strong> updates in the works.</p>
            <p>As always, thanks for playing Compensation, and we hope to see you in-game sometime!</p>
