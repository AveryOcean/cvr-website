            <h2>Update 1.4.0</h2>
            
            <p class="left">
                Our entire goal with this update was to create <codeblock><highlight>CVR</highlight>/Airsoft</codeblock>. We ran into some serious challenges, 
                and we hope we've managed to pull it off well. We missed some of the features we wanted because of time & techical constraints, 
                but it should hopefully still be worth playing. We know we've enjoyed playing & testing it, and we hope you will too.<br>
                <br>
                With that being said, here's the update, in full.
            </p>

            <h3>Major Updates</h3>
            <h4>Airsoft</h4>
            <p class="left">
                We've released a new CVR Original Room, we hope you enjoy it.<br>
                This is something we've been planning for almost a year now, since the beginning of modern CVR.<br>
                <br>
                <codeblock><highlight>CVR</highlight>/Airsoft</codeblock> is a competitive PvP game, where you fight against other players in a variety of environments.<br>
                The only available gamemode currently is Free For All, where players are all for themselves and must attack other players to score points.<br>
                There are currently two maps available, <codeblock>Quarry</codeblock> and <codeblock>Wet Work</codeblock>.<br>
                By default, you spawn in Quarry. From there, players can vote on the next map to play on, and it will change between games.<br>
                We hope that this room sets a new standard for CVR, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
            </p>

            <h3>Minor Updates</h3>
            <ul class="left">
                <li>
                    Due to bandwidth restrictions, you can now only print one photo at a time. <br>
                    Printing another photo after that will result in the previous one being removed.<br>
                    This is also due in part to moderation concerns over photographing text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We fixed the sign in the Lounge having staff members listed improperly.<br>
                    Sorry oregano!
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
            <ul class="left">
                <li>
                    Fixed an issue from the previous update that prevented users from logging in properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added safeguards to prevent disconnections for users with unstable internet.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>News</h3>
            <p class="left">
                We don't normally have a news section in our patch notes, but this is extremely important.<br>
                On 22 May 2022, we were attacked by an unknown individual, resulting in over 5000 erroneous images being uploaded to the API.<br>
                This resulted in the image API being down for 24 hours, and we were forced to disable image uploads to maintain server integrity.<br>
                You can read more about that event <a href="../../news/postmortem-22-05-2022/">here</a>, but that's not what this is about.<br>
                The fact that we were attacked without provocation is a very big step forward from our status as a small indie game, and we were forced to consider what this could mean for us as a game.<br>
                With that being said, we're taking a stronger focus on security and transparency moving forward, from hardening our servers and improving configuration to maintaining a safe environment for all users.<br>
                <br>
                In line with our new focus on security, we're still maintaining our Bug Bounty Program.<br>
                If you find a security vulnerability or other critical exploit, <strong>please</strong> report it to us so we can resolve it.<br>
                You can find more information about our Bug Bounty Program <a href="https://github.com/bubby932/VigorXRAPI/security/policy">here</a>.<br>
                If you're interested in looking over the source code of our servers, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/bubby932/VigorXRAPI/">here</a>. Our server infrastructure is entirely open sourced, meaning we rely on you to find problems that we missed.<br>
                With all that in mind, thank you, and we hope you enjoy this update!
