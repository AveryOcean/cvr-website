Update Log
# Compensation VR version 1.2.0

## Major updates

* We've added a new map! You can find it by going to your Watch, and pressing "Island" on the home menu!
*    This should be a nice place to hang out and enjoy yourself, and we plan to expand upon it soon.
* We've added a Messaging system! You can find it under your Watch Home Menu > "Social".
*    For now, there's only one server, but we plan to add Direct Messages, Group Chats, custom servers, and more.
* We've added the Capture Camera! This camera supports taking photos on both PCVR and standalone platforms!
*    You can find it under the "Tools" menu in your Watch, and spawn it using the green button. You can also despawn it using the red button.
*    Image captures are uploaded to our servers, meaning you will be able to view them online shortly!
* The Keyboard in both the watch and the login screen now supports a full en-US keyboard layout, including tab, return, caps lock, and more!

## Minor Changes

* On the backend of our systems we've converted all of our models into the FBX file format instead of using blend files.
* You may notice that the handholds in A Helpful Hand have been rearranged. During our conversion to FBX we had to redo the handholds entirely.

## Bug Fixes

* We've fixed index clipping at the base of both A Helpful Hand maps, due to a duplicate plane at the bottom of the map.
