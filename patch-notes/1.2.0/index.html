          <h2>Major Updates</h2>
          <hr class="hr_border">

          <h3>We've added a new map!</h3>
          <p>
               You can find the <i>Island</i> map in the Home menu of your Watch! We hope this will become a cozy social spot, or somewhere nice to chill out & relax.
          </p>

          <h3>We've added Messaging!</h3>
          <p>
               You can now message other players in a shared social hub, based off the likes of Discord and Guilded! This will soon be accessable from out of game.<br>
               At the moment, there is only an official server you can access. We plan to add custom servers, DMs, group chats, and more in the future.
          </p>

          <h3>The Capture Camera</h3>
          <p>
               We've added a new tool for those of you who like to capture the world around you. You can now use the <i>Capture Camera</i> to take snapshots of the world around you.<br>
               The camera supports Image capture (with video soon to come), and is <strong><i>PLATFORM AGNOSTIC!</i></strong><br>
               <br>
               Images are currently saved to our servers, and soon you will be able to view them online.<br>
               Additionally, you can adjust the FOV, width, and height of your images using the settings menu.<br>
          </p>

          <h3>New Keyboard Layout</h3>
          <p>
               To go along with the Social menu, we've added a full en-US keyboard layout to both the login keyboard and the watch keyboard!<br>
               This should be useful for messaging, as well as the long awaited ability to put return characters in your bio!
          </p>


          <h2>Minor Updates</h2>
          <hr class="hr_border">

          <h3>File Formatting</h3>
          <p>
               To accomodate our new developers in-game, we've converted all our 3D models from .blend to .fbx internally.<br>
               This should not affect normal players, please let us know if you encounter any broken models or collisions and we'll do our best to resolve it quicky.
          </p>
          <h3>A Helpful Hand</h3>
          <p>
               We've completely redone the handhold layouts in both A Helpful Hand levels, to accomodate our file format shift.
          </p>

          <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

          <h3>Index Clipping</h3>
          <p>
               We've resolved some Index Clipping / Z-Fighting issues on both A Helpful Hand maps, please let us know if you encounter the issues again!
          </p>

          <hr class="hr_border"><br>
          <p>As always, thank you for playing Compensation VR, and have fun! We're looking to host some Q&A sessions in-game in the lounge, so be on the lookout for those if you have any questions!</p>
