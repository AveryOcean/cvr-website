        <h1>1000 visits!</h1>
        <h2 class="left">That's a lot of visits!</h2>
        <p class="left">
            Since we added the visit counter, the number of visits on the apartment has slowly increased, until reaching it's current value of 1000. In the time since we originally added <codeblock>CVR/<highlight>Apartment</highlight></codeblock>,
            the game itself has changed massively. The Lounge was updated, the watch was completely redone, the Island was added, we finally released our long-awaited Airsoft, and more.<br>
            <br>
            In that time, our community has grown a surprising amount. We've seen people come and go, but overall we've made a lot of friends along the way.
            It's been a truly incredible experience to work with all of you, and we hope we can continue to improve CVR over the coming months.<br>
            <br>
            In the meantime, have fun in Compensation!
