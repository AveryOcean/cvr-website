                <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                    We do our best to share everything we can with both our community and other developers. <br>
                    The only way for games and computers to get better over time is if we collaborate and help each other. <br>
                    That's why we open source every single tool we develop, and aren't afraid to take advice from other developers. <br>
                    
                    <!--<h2>Ready, Aim, Fire</h2>-->
                    <h2>Planning</h2>
                    We put time and effort into the <i>planning</i> of every update and feature we make, before we even touch a key or make a model. <br>
                    We take feedback from our community to the best of our ability and aren't afraid to take advice from other developers. <br>
                    
                    <h2>Testing</h2>
                    We test every single feature thoroughly before we even think about releasing it.
                    We plan time in advance for slowdowns and bug fixes, because they are <i>going</i> to happen, it's just a matter of when.
                    We set goals and do our absolute best to finish on time, and even before them if we can.
                    If we miss a goal, we recover quickly and keep moving.

                    <h2>Community</h2>
                    We have an amazing community of playtesters and even other developers who help new players and even contribute to the game on occasion. <br>

                    <h2>Economy</h2>
                    Vigor XR has no microtransactions, and it will stay that way. No subscriptions, no buying currency, nothing. <br>
                    Our in-game items are fairly priced to the best of out abilities and are not excessively priced.
                    We don't have investors to please, so we can take the business side out of the equation completely.
                    
                    <h2>Feedback</h2>
                    We're willing to take feedback and suggestions, and we don't just write everything off as <i>coming soon</i> or <i>delayed</i>. <br>
                    We're willing to be fully transparent about what we're working on, and what our problems are. <br>
